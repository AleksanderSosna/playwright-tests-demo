# PLAYWRIGHT-TESTS-DEMO

This repository serves as a demonstration of how I - @AleksanderSosna - structure my Playwright automated tests.

It may also be useful on new projects where there is no test automation developed yet to just copy-paste the code and get started fast without spending too much time on configuration.

Please keep in mind that the "tests" included here were not developed for a real life test cases. They just serve a demonstration purpose.

The codebase and use examples will be expanded over time to show a broader range of Playwright possibilities to parametrize, parallelize, shard tests etc. It should also include examples of E2E tests, API tests, Frontend tests with mocked Backend etc.
